# OOP Project - Classes: Date, Employee, Part_time, Full_time, Repository, Employee_repository, Menu

This is my third oop project. The project contains the classes from the second project but the menu is in a new
class and the employee vector is now a repo. To run the menu decomment the line with start_menu. In main there 
are some commands to test the repo and some of the methods.
